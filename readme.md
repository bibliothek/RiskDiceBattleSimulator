# Risk Dice Battle Simulator

This Python CLI tool randomly calculates the outcome of battles in [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game))

Instead of rolling the dice you can enter the number of attacking and defending troops and the winner will be randomly determined.

## Usage

Calculate the outcome of a battle:

    RiskDiceBattleSimulator.py NUMBER_OF_ATTACKERS NUMBER_OF_DEFENDERS
	
Calculate the outcome of many runs of the same battle:

    RiskDiceBattleSimulator.py NUMBER_OF_ATTACKERS NUMBER_OF_DEFENDERS NUMBER_OF_RUNS
